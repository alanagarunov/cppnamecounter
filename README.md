IRC/Discord log counter/analysis

In one of my python discord bots, I had a feature where it logged everything that was said in the channels that it was in.   This, program, made in c++ simply counts how many times a certain person talked, and can be modified to include more.  
There will be more functionality, for now I want to get the full program on here.  
I also chose c++ for this because I am familiar with the functions to do this sort of task and I think it works best for this.  

**Installation:**  
Put all of the files in its own directory.  
From the directory in terminal, simply type, 'make main  
Then type ./main to see results.  

One of the things this will do in the future will be to accept paramters for different things.
